[s]erver-[h]osted [i]ntelligent [n]eural-net [e]nvironment

shine is a Python library for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with focus on deep-neural-nets and deep-RL
(as opposed to more RL-theory-focused libraries like BURLAP). shine comes with it's own RL-Game-Engine called spygame (shine + pygame)
based on the PyGame library.

## who should use shine?
<b>Answer</b>: people who ...
- are interested in RL algorithm research
- would like to test their ideas on simple 2D game environments (MDPs), which you can create using only a tiled map (tmx file)
-
